# What will you need?

1 x Arduino Uno (or any UNO based dev board)
1 x Servo Motor
1 x Ultrasonic Sensor
1 x Bread Board
Jumper Wires
5v power supply

# Connecting

In order not to have to modify the code, the cableing is done as following

### Ultrasonic Sensor

echo - pin 10
trig - pin 9
Vcc - 5v pin
Gnd - Gnd pin

### Servo Motor

signal - pin 11
Vcc - 5v pin
Gnd - Gnd pin

### What I Have Used
